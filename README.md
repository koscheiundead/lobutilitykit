# Lob Utility Kit
## An unofficial desktop application for core Lob functionality
- Bulk sending
- Bulk cancellation
- Data export

## To install
Navigate to the most recent release (*v0.5.0-alpha*) and identify the installer for your platform. If you are on a **Mac** device, utilize the Mac installer ending in *.dmg* to install the Utility Kit. If you are on a **Windows** device, utilize the Windows installer ending in *.exe* to install the Utility Kit.

## Getting started
The first thing you will want to do is retrieve your API key(s) from your Lob account. You can find them in the API Keys tab of your account settings page [here](dashboard.lob.com/settings/api-keys). You will need your **secret keys** for this application (not the publishable keys).

Copy your secret keys from your settings, then paste and upload them into the Settings page of the application. When you click the button to save your key, the application will automatically check the key for validity. If you have active keys, you shouldn't get an alert, but you may see an issue with your Live key if you don't have a payment method on file (this is expected).

If you don't get an alert and see that your keys have saved, that's it! You're done! You can now move on to using the app.

## For help
If you would like a walkthrough on how to use the application, you can find documentation in the Help tab in your menu bar. If you run into an unexpected issue within the app, open an issue here on GitHub to report it.
